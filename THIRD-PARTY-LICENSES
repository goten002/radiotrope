Third-Party Licenses
====================

Radiotrope depends on the following third-party libraries that have licenses
differing from the project's MIT license. All other dependencies are licensed
under MIT, Apache-2.0, or a dual MIT/Apache-2.0 license.

Audio demuxing and decoding library.

The MPL-2.0 is a file-level copyleft license. Symphonia's source files remain
under MPL-2.0. If you modify any Symphonia source files and distribute the
result, you must make those modifications available under the MPL-2.0.

Using Symphonia as an unmodified dependency (as this project does) does not
